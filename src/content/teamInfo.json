Patrick’s work focuses on integrated spatial planning, which considers projections of climate change and land use to inform decision making for conservation alongside productive and mixed-use landscapes. Patrick also has expertise in biodiversity informatics, biogeography, ecosystem services modeling and climate change vulnerability assessments.  He serves as the co-lead for the  biodiversity hub of the Science Based Targets Network, a group of organizations working to shape private sector impacts on nature by using science-based targets. ",
